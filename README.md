# Coursera-ML-assignment


This repo contains my assignments for [Deep Learning on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). All the code base, lectures and instructions are taken from, unless specified this course. 

All the solution code are upload for **my own future reference**, anyone studying the above course should follow [Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) and DO NOT copy these solution code. If you are stucked by these assignments and therefore find here, I strongly recommend you read the instructions given carefully one more time, if still stucked, read these solutions and try to code yourself. In this way, maybe later weeks, you will know better what this block of codes used for. (Do not just Copy&Paste, it will be a waste of time)
